Notes on Universal Acceptance tool for Java
---------------------------------------------

The distribution includes pre-compiled JAR files:
  - tldverify.jar                   the Universal Acceptance tool without dependencies

Currently tldverify is depended on
commons-codec version 1.3, commons-io version 2.1, commons-lang version 2.6, dnsjava version 2.1.1 slf4j version 1.6.1
To run the tests, you will need the TestNG-6.0.1.jar (http://testng.org/doc/index.html)  and fest-assert-1.4.jar (http://fest.easytesting.org/) as well.

In addition, the main distribution includes all the source code and build script for tld-verify as well as an example application.

You will need maven (http://maven.apache.org/) to take advantage of the build file and to run the example application.
With maven installed, use the commands "mvn package" and "mvn exec:java" from the library root directory to run the example application.
To run the tests, run the command "mvn test"
